# Internal Code Documentation: Chogi Game Model

[TOC]

## 1. Introduction

This document provides internal documentation for the Chogi game model, outlining the structure and functionality of the core components.  The code defines a set of classes and types used to represent the game state, players, pieces, and the game board itself.  These are imported from other modules within the project, leveraging modularity for maintainability and organization.


## 2. Module Structure

The module `chogi_game_model` (implicitly defined by the presence of the `__all__` variable) exports the following key components:

| Component         | Description                                                              | Module of Origin |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `Model`           | (Details not provided in the given code snippet)  The main game model class. Likely responsible for managing the overall game state and logic.     | `.model`         |
| `GameState`       |  Enum or class representing the different states a game can be in (e.g., in progress, won, drawn).    | `.project_types` |
| `GameStatus`      | Enum or class representing the status of the game (e.g., ongoing, player1_win, player2_win, draw).     | `.project_types` |
| `Player`          | Class representing a player in the game, likely containing attributes such as ID, name, and potentially score.      | `.project_types` |
| `Location`        | Class representing a position on the game board. Likely contains coordinates or indices.   | `.project_types` |
| `Piece`           | Class representing a game piece. Likely contains attributes like type, location, and possibly owner.  | `.project_types` |
| `PieceType`       | Enum or class defining the different types of pieces in the game (e.g., general, soldier, chariot).    | `.project_types` |
| `Trait`           |  (Details not provided in the given code snippet) Likely represents special abilities or characteristics of pieces. | `.project_types` |
| `ChogiBoard`      | Class representing the game board.  Likely a 2D array or a similar data structure to hold pieces.  | `.project_types` |
| `ChogiPieceInfo`  | (Details not provided in the given code snippet) Likely a data structure holding information about individual pieces. | `.project_types` |


## 3.  Import Statements and `__all__`

The module starts by importing necessary components from other modules:

* `from .model import Model`: Imports the `Model` class from the `model` module (likely in the same package).
* `from .project_types import (GameState, GameStatus, Player, Location, Piece, PieceType, Trait, ChogiBoard, ChogiPieceInfo)`: Imports several type definitions and classes related to the game's data structures from the `project_types` module.


The `__all__` variable explicitly specifies the public interface of this module.  Only the listed components will be accessible when importing this module into other parts of the project.  This ensures controlled exposure of the module's contents and prevents accidental access to internal implementation details.


## 4. Conclusion

This documentation provides a high-level overview of the Chogi game model module.  Further detailed documentation for individual classes and functions would reside within their respective files.  The provided code snippet only shows the module's import structure and public API.  Further information about the actual implementation of the classes (e.g., `Model`, `Trait`, `ChogiPieceInfo`) would require reviewing the code from the imported modules.
