# Internal Code Documentation: Controller Module

[TOC]

## 1. Overview

This document provides internal documentation for the `controller` module.  The module currently exports a single class: `Controller`.  The implementation details of the `Controller` class are contained within the `controller.py` file (not included here, but referenced).  This document focuses on the module's structure and the class it exposes.


## 2. Module Structure

The `controller` module is designed for a clean and simple architecture.  Its primary purpose is to provide an interface to the core controller functionality.

| Element      | Description                                         |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `__all__`    | Defines the public interface of the module. Currently, only the `Controller` class is publicly accessible. |
| `from .controller import Controller` | Imports the `Controller` class from the `controller` submodule.  This indicates a hierarchical structure within the project.   |


## 3.  `Controller` Class (Detailed in `controller.py`)

While the exact implementation of the `Controller` class is outside the scope of this module-level documentation and resides in `controller.py`, it's important to note its role.   The `__all__` statement explicitly exposes this class for use in other parts of the application.  Any detailed explanation of its methods, attributes, or internal algorithms would need to be found within the `controller.py` file's internal documentation.
